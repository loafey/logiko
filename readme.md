# logiko

A puzzle game where you create Fitch-style natural deduction proofs under a time limit.

Made over the course of a week while I should have studied for my Logic re-exam.

As it was made rather quickly bugs may exist and the game is somewhat 
rough around the edges, and if you find anything that should be improved 
please email me at [bugs@loafey.se]("mailto:bugs@loafey.se/) or at loafey on Discord.

The code is currently somewhat rough (a lot of needless cloning ðŸ¥²), but that will improve in the future!

A live version of the game can be found at: [loafey.se/logiko]("https://loafey.se/logiko)".
